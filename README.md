# Mortgage Approval Pandemic Analysis

### Brief Summary
Inspired by The Markup's investigative reporting into the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which reports all individual mortgage applications including characteristics like applicants' self-reported race, income, and loan amount, as well as the final approval/rejection decision, I wanted to explore the 2018 to 2020 data sets and understand how the pandemic may have affected approval rates.
