    "I ran a simple regression on loan_amount using two independent variables: applicant_income and applicant_age (whether they were below 25 or between 25-34).  I was very curious about the mortgage sizes that people my age were securing.  As preparation for my independent project (where I will use this same data set), I decided to explore single-family home mortgages only so my data was subset by these two additional conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In running my simple regression, I noticed that my income coefficient was statistically significant but not my applicant_age coefficient.  My R-squared value of 0.310 seems quite high (more than 20%).  In terms of my coefficients, it tells me that a 1% increase in income will yield a \\\\$13,160 increase in the loan amount requested.  While my regression's intercept is negative and feels unintuitive (since a mortgage can't be negative), the negative intercept makes sense since you need a certain level of income to even qualify for a mortgage (which is not zero)."

I chose this 45-year-old threshold because this would be a likely age for parents of applicants below 25 years old, and gives me a 10 year gap between the oldest of my applicant subset (34 years old) as to minimize relationships with large age gaps."

The coefficients for applicant_age and parent by themselves were not statistically significant, but the interaction term (where applicant_age was multiplied by the parent dummy) yielded a p-value of 0.014, so the interaction term was statistically significant.  However, the direction of the interaction was surprising: it is negative.  This means that when someone is under 25 and the co-applicant is someone above 45 (likely their parent), then they request $98,790 less for their mortgage. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might be explained by the fact that if someone is under 25 and single (since they aren't buying a place where their similarly-aged partner is the co-applicant), they are trying to buy a much smaller and therefore less expensive single-family home than a young couple who might seek a single-family property to start a family.  Likewise, if someone under 25 with negligible wealth does not qualify for a mortgage of any size by themselves, the inclusion of their parent as their co-applicant may be in essence a \"Hail Mary\" to help them get the smallest mortgage possible."

    "* I plan to investigate racial discrimination in US mortgage approvals between 2019 and 2020.  I am curious about how soaring demand for single-family properties during the beginning of the pandemic may have influenced who was approved for mortgages to move into \"more desired\" neighborhoods.  To narrow the scope, I will focus on Ohio census tracts and single-family homes.  I chose this scope because Ohio had one of the highest property value growth rates in the country and it has about equal proportions of White and Black residents.\n",

This occurs because mortgage lenders' algorithms (while they claim to be unbiased) can gatekeep and select for certain demographics in desirable communities.  After all, redlining has proven to be a discriminatory practice that endures to this day, so I want to explore whether the pandemic exacerbated this behavior.\n",
